#CSE 231 Project #4
#   Given a text, find the decoded text using the shift 
#   To perform this task, first decode the character in the string LETTERS
#   Then find the shift of the characters in the cipher text 
#       This can be done by finding the most occuring character in the text
#           And finding the shift from that character to "e"
#           We use "e" because "e" is the most occuring character 
#       In order to do this use the enumerate method 
#   Then using the most occuring character and shift print the decoded text
#   Use ignore to ignore the spaces in the text 
#       If the spaces aren't ignored they will be the most occurring char
#   Call the defined functions in order to decode the text 
#   Using a while loop ask the user if the decoded text is readable or not 
#       if not readable run all the process again until the user inputs yes 
#   End the program if the text is readable in english
